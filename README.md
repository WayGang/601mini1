This system is combined with python and database(mysql and mongodb)
For mysql's example:
Using "runmysql" to run the system, then you may enter your name, and which twitteruser you want to find, and
the path where you want the vedio to store.
Then you can choose to either insert or query the data to the database.

Mongodb is very simple, you are clever, so I don't need to explain how to run "runmongo".

Requirements:
Prepare your own Twitter Developer's API KEY.
Have mysql and mongodb in your computer.
Create database like "bulidingdatabase" said.
